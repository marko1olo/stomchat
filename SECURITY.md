## 🎯 2. Domain Threat Model & Attack Surfaces

Security engineering in marko1olo/stomchat is guided by the following domain-specific threat vector analyses:

### 1. Medical Misinformation Injection
* **Description**: Poisoning RAG vector store with inaccurate dental guidance.
* **Impact Rating**: HIGH / CRITICAL
* **Mitigation Strategy**: Strict schema validation, boundary fuzz testing, and automated static security analysis.
### 2. Session Hijacking
* **Description**: Unauthorized takeover of active patient triage chat sessions.
* **Impact Rating**: HIGH / CRITICAL
* **Mitigation Strategy**: Strict schema validation, boundary fuzz testing, and automated static security analysis.
### 3. PII Data Leakage
* **Description**: Transmission of patient symptoms and contact info over unencrypted transport.
* **Impact Rating**: HIGH / CRITICAL
* **Mitigation Strategy**: Strict schema validation, boundary fuzz testing, and automated static security analysis.

## 🚨 3. Vulnerability Reporting & Disclosure Protocol

If you discover a security flaw or exploit vector in **marko1olo/stomchat**, do **NOT** post it publicly in open issues or discussions.

### 3.1 Submission Workflow
1. Navigate to the **Security** tab on GitHub -> **Advisories** -> **Report a vulnerability**.
2. Alternatively, open a cryptographically signed advisory to the syndicate maintainers.
3. Provide the following details:
   * Subsystem and affected source files / line numbers.
   * Step-by-step minimal reproduction script or payload.
   * Assessment of potential exploit impact (memory corruption, data exfiltration, DoS).

---

## ⏱️ 4. Response SLAs & Remediation Timelines

* **Initial Triage & Acknowledgment**: Within **24–48 hours**.
* **Vulnerability Verification & Reproducer**: Within **3 business days**.
* **Remediation Patch Development**: Within **7 business days**.
* **Public Coordinated Disclosure**: Published simultaneously with the verified patch release.

---

## 💎 5. Defensive Engineering Architecture

All code running in this repository must adhere to defensive coding invariants:
* **Memory Bounds Checking**: All slice offsets, vector indices, and WebAssembly linear memory allocations are strictly bounded.
* **Input Sanitization**: External network payloads, uploaded files, and deserialized states must be validated before ingestion.
* **Cryptographic Rigor**: Sensitive tokens, cryptographic keys, and hashes must use standard constant-time comparison algorithms to eliminate timing side-channels.

---

## 🔍 6. Dependency Auditing & Supply Chain Safety

1. Automated daily vulnerability scans on all dependencies via `npm audit` / `cargo audit` / `pip-audit`.
2. All lockfiles are committed and pinned to immutable cryptographic hashes.
3. Third-party vendor updates require manual review of code diffs to prevent supply chain poisoning.

## 👥 7. Syndicate Security Contacts

Developed, audited, and maintained under the security direction of **Жирняк** & **Адольф Петушков**.
